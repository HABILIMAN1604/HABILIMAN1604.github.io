                        <p>Hey, I'm Habil Iman, a 21-year-old second-year computer science student. I really enjoy making websites and systems that are easy to use and look good.
                           I got into coding a few years back when I was in matriculation. At first, it was tough, but once I got the hang of the basics, it became much easier. 
                           I love the feeling of creating something and seeing it work the way I want.
                           Now, as I'm studying computer science, I'm excited about learning even more. It's like I've unlocked the ability to understand things that seemed impossible 
                           before. Coding went from one of the hardest things for me to something I really enjoy and feel confident about. I believe in the power of learning and adapting, 
                           and this transformative experience has fueled my enthusiasm for the limitless possibilities within the realm of computer science
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to coding, I'm an avid learner, a problem solver, and a creative thinker. I believe in the power of technology to bring positive changes to the world.
                        </p>
