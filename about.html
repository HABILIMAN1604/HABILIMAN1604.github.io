                    <p>Hi. My name is Habil Iman. I'm 21 years old. I'm currently a second year student in computer science.
                        I'm a passionate developer with a love for designing and building user-friendly, elegant websites and functional system.
                        My journey in the world of coding began several years ago, when I was studying in matriculation. Ever since i started coding
                        I have developed a deep love towards building systems especially websites. There's something addictive when you develop your
                        project and it worked accordingly. Then here I am learning more about computer science, taking my degree in computer science.
                        I feel like I have the power to learn things that at first was impossible to me. when I first started coding, I think it was one
                        of the hardest subject I've learned, but after i grasp the basic, it was not as hard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to coding, I'm an avid learner, a problem solver, and a creative thinker. I believe in the power of technology to bring positive changes to the world.
                    </p>
